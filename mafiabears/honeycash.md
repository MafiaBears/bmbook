# Earning $HASH

## What is $HASH?

$HASH is a token that enhances interactivity within the MafiaBears gamified ecosystem, and ultimately provides more utility to users within MafiaBears. What does that mean, exactly? By giving users ways to earn and spend $HASH, we're able to give them more things to do! Put another way, $HASH reinforces our gamified economy, and a healthy economy is what will allow us to grow and add more and more cool stuff to MafiaBears.

$HASH exists as an ERC20 token on Ethereum; it's claimable/earnable within the world of MafiaBears.

## What can I do with $HASH?

$HASH is the key to all sorts of functionality and fun in the MafiaBears ecosystem, from buying $BMS to mutations in the future. $HASH is also how you'll enhance and level up your MafiaBear...and that's just the beginning. Over time, we'll add more and more features and functions that you'll need $HASH to fully enjoy.

Once purchased your bears will generate HASH for you.

## How do I earn $HASH?

There are a number of ways right now to earn $HASH. If you're a MafiaBear holder, you're already earning it! Your MafiaBear is earning $HASH just by being mafia (the $HASH claiming clock begins as soon as the contract is deployed), and that $HASH will accumulate over time. Though your Bear is earning $Hash every day, you can claim your $HASH anytime you wish--once a day, once a week, once a month, etc. Here's how:

* Visit [https://mafiabears.com](https://mafiabears.com/#/).
* Connect your wallet (e.g. Metamask).
* In the "MY GANG" section click 'Claim HASH' to claim the $MILK for all of the MafiaBears you currently hold.

The amount of HoneyCash you will receive depends on the number of your bears and their level.\
The more bears and the higher their level, the more HoneyCash you get.  Keep in mind that `claim` function is executed implicitly when you change the MafiaBear roster.\
\
Another way to earn $HASH is to buy it on sites such as Uniswap, Pancakeswap, etc.

## How much $HASH does my MafiaBear earn?

MafiaBears earn a base rate of 14.3 $HASH each day, with incremental $HASH bonuses based on their level. As we add additional features to MafiaBears, other tier-related benefits will be distributed throughout the ecosystem, so keep an eye out for more $HASH-earning opportunities in the coming months.&#x20;
