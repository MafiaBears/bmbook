# Lore

## `Prologue`

The Great Honey Depression struck Bear City like lightning, which is located in the very center of the Sugar Continent. In just a few years, the once flourishing city was divided into buzzing, restless, endlessly fussing and conflicting «hives», each of which lived its own life and was suspicious of strangers.

Good-natured and wise bears, whose diligence and patience allowed Bear City to turn from a modest village inhabited by fishermen and beekeepers into a huge metropolis in two centuries, were no longer the owners of the city. A protracted economic crisis brought down the stock markets and ruined the banks, which was a real disaster for Bear City. The ruthless principle of dominoes very soon brought almost all areas of the bear's life to a deplorable state...

Of course, some of the peoples of the planet Cradle had it even worse. Residents of Dinosaur Lands and Mammoth Beach from the Strange Park continent have a lot to say about this. Of course, if extinct species could speak. However, the bears quite sincerely believed that their fate was not much better. In general, dear reader, you undoubtedly already understood the main thing - the life of the citizens of Bear City could no longer be called sweet.

Evolution and civilization have long driven bears who love light and space into the narrow labyrinths of city streets, but never before have these streets been so dark, gloomy and dangerous. The crisis changed not only the economic situation of the bears, it broke the mentality, attitude to life, changed tastes, gave rise to anxiety and fear.

Honest bears, not accustomed to sitting idle, for the first time faced with such phenomena as unemployment and labor exchange, corruption, yellow press, gambling, criminal gangs, loans at crazy interest rates, lack of affordable housing, incredible price increases. But the worst thing is that the favorite product and the main resource of all the bears in the city - honey - were banned! The Bear City authorities introduced a «dry law», which was in the hands of the mafia and the government, but it hurt ordinary citizens. What can I say - even the classical music beloved by all was replaced by raucous and unleashed jazz, under which it is so good to remember happy times at the bar over a glass of raspberry tincture.

Yes, the crisis gave rise to an unprecedented depression that has been going on for ten long years. Bears have learned to live for today. The hope for the return of the «golden honey era» was fading every year, and it already seemed too many that it would always be like this.

## `Story`

### `Chapter I`
****

On a cold autumn morning, two young bears were walking along the dank streets of Bear City. Maybe it will surprise you a little, but their names were Bear and Bear. This is explained by the fact that the inhabitants of the city suffered from a complete lack of imagination in terms of names. Actually, things were just as sad with nicknames, so they were known to friends and acquaintances as Fatso and Long. Of course, you already guessed that one of them was small and plump, and the other was tall and thin, but both were equally strong and deadly. The pointed caps and white markings on the chest spoke eloquently of their affiliation with the Grizzly gang, one of Bear City's most formidable criminal gangs.

Long held several photographs in his paw and adjusted the large revolver in his shoulder holster every second. The Fatso walked quickly, his «Colt» hung from a wide belt. The goal of the bandits stuck out in the center of a small area, like a rotten tooth forgotten by a dentist. The gray building of the Labor Exchange, the abode of despair and deceived hopes, could not accommodate everyone – unemployed hard-working bears, their shaggy muzzles downcast, stood in a long line right in the rain. Almost everyone was silent and smoking gloomily. Occasionally there was an indistinct rustle of turning pages of a wet newspaper or a hoarse cough.

When there were a few steps left before the turn, Fatso lightly nudged his colleague with his elbow:

\- My brother, - he croaked in a low bass, - soon he will also be here.

Long frowned:

\- Is that the one that got fired from the couch factory?

\- That's it, - the fat bear confirmed, - the same one. Moss Inc. is a firm called. Almost everyone was thrown out, and those who remained work for pennies. Well, and my brother too - under staff reduction. Six months already with his wife without cones sit. He never learned to hoard. But there were good times! Now what? Whoever has the cones left can try to buy government bonds, my wife and I did just that…and now we are sitting and thinking - did lost our money or not? Our state will not miss its own.

At that moment, Long walked up to the queue and, turning some hard worker towards him, compared his gloomy face with one of the photographs. The elderly Bear-Gardener showed yellow broken fangs, but when he saw who was in front of him, he lowered his muzzle. With the guys from the Grizzly gang, no one wanted to come into conflict.

Moving further along the queue, the bandits continued their unhurried conversation, turning other bears around like silent scarecrows. The line got even quieter.

\- My brother wanted to join our organization, - Fatso wheezed, - but they did not take him. He is weak, unreliable, not fit for business. The simplest work cannot be assigned. Yes, and he didn’t really want to…a taiga humanist!

\- Bad luck, - the colleague sympathized, peering intently into the muzzle of another unemployed bear and comparing it with photographs. – But my father, when they didn’t even think about the crisis, began to invest cones in honey. It seems stupid to save honey in Bear City, but look how it turned out! Now for a drop of honey you can exchange so many products - everything will not fit into the trunk of a «Ford»! Even if you buy on the market with their biting prices…

The fat bear did not answer right away - he looked angrily at the little red Postman-Bear, who did not immediately look away. The postman lowered his head, the satisfied gangster couple moved on.

\- Of course, in the market to buy, where else? Fatso grinned. - Stores are empty. Oh, I don't know what will happen to my brother, by God. He poked himself into the trade union; he thought they would help him there. Help, yes! The Brown Bears rule there. A little something is wrong - all cones and honey will be taken away to the last drop, if found. You will also be glad that you didn’t become a rug by the fireplace.

\- Brown bears, - Long shrugged his shoulders, - will not stand on ceremony.

The bandits finally found their prey. In vain, a grizzly named Fisherbear in an impossibly greasy jacket carefully turned his muzzle to the side - Long, after consulting the photograph, put his paw on his shoulder and led him out of the queue, which still maintained respectful silence. Worthy representatives of the Grizzly gang led Fisherbear around the corner, but before getting down to business, the fat bandit decided to end the conversation with a long-prepared tirade:

\- In general, survive as you want, no one will pull you by the withers - that's what I told my brother. Intercontinental corporations go bankrupt, stocks collapse, open a newspaper - all obituaries of suicides, just horror. Depression!

Long, during the closing speech of his partner, did not waste time - he carefully examined the guy in a greasy jacket, and he obviously did not feel too comfortable - his black eyes were running, and his head seemed to just grow into his shoulders.

\- Heard? These are difficult times; it is a pity that many do not realize this. Here you are, for example! - He pointed at the victim's chest. - You owe Godfather Grizzly a bunch of bumps, but you don’t do anything!

Categorically refuting this statement, the shabby Fisherbear scratched himself at that moment.

\- So what to do with you, Teddy? Or what's your name?

Such an obvious insult as «Teddy» would not be taken down by any self-respecting bear, but Fisherbear has long lost the remnants of self-respect. He just shrugged his stooped shoulders, and then suddenly began to speak loudly:

\- So after all - beavers! Sure thing - backwater, so no! Dams, carps - honey! And then the shares went down, I went to the beavers - they are already in Canada! What to do? I'm at the labor market. I respect Godfather Grizzly a lot, I don’t like beavers anymore…

Fatso grimaced, and then suddenly deftly searched the Teddy's pockets with practiced quick movements. After this manipulation, three pitiful cones lay on his huge paw, one smaller than the other.

\- Three fir cones? Long said skeptically. - Is that all you have left of your brilliant beaver, dam, and carp operation? Canada, Teddy? What the hell – Canada?! There is no such place in the world! Have you decided to find a job through the labor exchange? And how many years were you going to work hard for pennies to earn 50,000 cones? Bears don't even live that long in a Zoo, Teddy! I don't understand what you are trying to achieve with your stories?

\- He probably wants us to slip Godfather Grizzly his story about beavers from fairyland instead of cones, - Fatso suggested, - I guess he takes our boss for a blissful idiot, and thinks that the cones fall into his pocket straight from the sky!

### `Chapter II`
****

In the next few minutes, Fisherbear would have had a very bad time, the fat Bear in the most unambiguous way took him by the withers and slightly lifted him off the ground, and Long was already preparing to strike, but then fate intervened in the matter. Something really fell from the sky. Those weren't cones! Just a couple of meters from our heroes, a massive body of an adult bear collapsed onto the asphalt.

Screams, screeching, stomping, blood-stained white shirt of the dead man... Fisherbear ran away with all his might, but the gangsters had no time for him - they looked at the dead bear. They were frightened, but professionalism gradually overcame other emotions - Long raised his head and determined that the body most likely fell from the twentieth floor. The window there was wide open, which in such bad weather and constant smog was unreasonable. Above the squalid little rooms of the Labor Exchange were offices that only prosperous businessmen, lawyers, brokers and insurers could rent. It was from such an office that the bear fell out, saving with its spectacular appearance the dirty skin of the unlucky friend of the beavers.

A whirlpool of passions was already boiling around - a small crowd had gathered at the scene of the incident, bear muzzles protruded from the windows, screams and patter of paws became louder, as did hysterical calls to urgently call the police and a doctor. The fat bear winced.


\- Why in such cases there are always idiots yelling at the top of their lungs that a bear that has fallen from the twentieth floor urgently needs a doctor?

\- Inertia of thinking, - Long explained to him, - Although, on the other hand, it would be very strange if someone started shouting now: «Hurry, call the undertaker, every second is precious»! Fatso chuckled and shrugged. Without saying a word, the bandits left the crowd and stopped a few meters from the epicenter of the incident. Everything they needed, they found out, and it was completely unnecessary to attract too much attention to them.


The deceased was a grizzly bear - large, middle-aged and very rich. This could be seen from the broken gold watch and diamond cufflinks. The Bear and the Bear knew perfectly well who this unfortunate man was. They did not leave - they were waiting for the real police to find out anything else - in this situation, any information was worth its weight in honey. In the meantime, only a young constable was spinning near the body, giving stupid instructions to the doctor of the «ambulance» and trying to hold back the onslaught of the crowd. But the guys from the Grizzly gang had no doubt that the incident would definitely force the chief of the city police to get his fat ass out of his comfortable chair. \
The gangsters were not mistaken - in a few minutes; the Old Polar himself appeared at the Labor Exchange building, a huge polar bear, whose hair has long acquired a gray tint due to a wrong lifestyle. He arrived not alone, but with his team, which quickly put things in order - the crowd was dispersed and pushed back a few meters, the experts began to examine the body, the operatives interviewed witnesses and pulled on wide orange ribbons. The constable went to his crossroads and Fatso and Long reacted to the appearance of the big bosses in their own way - they took off their pointed caps and hid their weapons. At the same time, they did their best to get as close to the scene as possible without being noticed.

\- It remains only to wait for her, - said Fatso quietly.&#x20;

His partner gave a short nod in response. \
«She» arrived at the scene just five minutes after Old Polar - Artemis Ginger, a small sharp-nosed she-bear, beautiful, smart and sly. These are the qualities that a top reporter for the Bear News Time, the city's most widely read newspaper, should have. \
Artemis pushed the crowd aside and headed straight for the dead body. The chief of police, depicting a semblance of a smile on his ferocious muzzle, warmly welcomed the intruder.

\- Hey Tony! - The reporter shouted to the photographer accompanying her, completely ignoring the greeting of the Old Polar. - Get a couple of good shots before the body is taken away. The chief of police did not utter a word, although his black eyes flickered for a moment with a desperate desire to claw his fangs at the throat of this little bitch. His patience was explained simply - the Mayor of Bear City loved to appear on the front page of the most popular newspaper. His vanity made Miss Ginger one of the most powerful people in the city, with a particularly sharp-nosed Artemis interested in police activities.

\- Do you know who it is? - She asked Old Polar, nodding in the direction of the corpse.

\- We have just begun an investigation...

\- Oh, come on, chef! - Artemis interrupted irritably. - This is Uncle Grizzly, every little bear in the city already knows about it. Well, what's the motive?

\- What's the motive? The appearance of importunate reporters here? It probably has something to do with the circulation of your newspaper.

\- Not funny. The motive for the murder or suicide, which, in general, at this stage are only details. Any ideas? The guys from the Grizzly gang quietly moved forward and now greedily hung on every word.

\- No, - the Old Polar reluctantly admitted, - as I said, we have just begun an investigation.

\- Come on, - Artemis smiled broadly, turning on the first transmission of her charm, - everyone knows that the mayor’s office turned off Uncle’s new railway project, and without this contract, his factory was doomed, especially considering the collapse of shares on the stock exchange. In fact, Uncle Grizzly was ruined...add here the dark dealings with Pandas and Polar Bears...and he was not lucky with his relatives. Fatso and Long looked at each other.

\- Listen, Miss Ginger! - Old Polar began to lose his temper. - I do not collect gossip; my job is to investigate real crimes, and not to get lost in your conjectures!

\- By the way, - Artemis inquired innocently, as if she had not heard his tirade, - did you find his daughter? They say she was kidnapped by the Pandas when Uncle's business went really bad...                    &#x20;

The guys from the Grizzly gang carefully left the crowd and ran to their car, parked right on the sidewalk. The received information should be delivered to the addressee as quickly as possible.

### `Chapter III`
****

&#x20;   Godfather Grizzly's office was on the third floor of the old mansion. His looked out the window, behind which was the largest park in the city, carefully preserving the true look of autumn. Fatso and Long froze at the boss's huge desk, not daring to break the silence with a single sound.\
\- How are things with your brother? \
Godfather Grizzly's voice suited his appearance perfectly - a low pleasant bass of an adult, but not yet an old bear, who prefers expensive suits and good books. Fatso winced and glanced at his partner before answering.

\- No news yet, boss.

\- Let him come to me tomorrow. There is a job in one small company owned by the family. Nothing illegal - the money is small, but honest.

\- Thanks, boss.

\- So, this is how it ended for my cousin? And little Ellie is now in the dirty paws of Pandas… Long could not contain his surprise:

\- You didn't know about it?

\- No, - answered Godfather Grizzly, - we stopped talking a couple of years ago. Uncle asked me not to interfere in his affairs, I did not insist. He is older and more experienced than me; I thought that he would figure everything out on his own. Perhaps he blamed me for his troubles. Maybe he thought I was trying to hurt him, or maybe my reputation is getting in the way of his projects. What did Miss Ginger say? That he was unlucky with his relatives?

\- Yes, boss, - the bandits answered in unison. \
Godfather Grizzly chuckled.

\- Maybe she's right. Miss Ginger has a surprisingly sharp not only tongue, but also a mind. So you think she knows more than she told the police?\
&#x20;Long cleared his throat.

\- Yes, boss. When the Old Bear finally stood up and rested his forehead, Artemis fell silent and drove away. I think she knows a lot more.

\- I understand, - the mafia boss came up to the table and put his heavy paws on the tabletop. The table creaked piteously. - Talk to her. But do not forget that she is one of the most respected bears in Bear City, and the Mayor who adores her will make life much more difficult for us if she thinks that she was treated inappropriately. Offer her money, I will order Einstein, offer a lot of money, but get all the information you need! And then… \
Godfather Grizzly sank heavily into his chair. Fatso and Long were waiting - they already knew what the essence of their task would be, and were quite ready for this.

\- And then find Ellie. Whatever my brother thought of me, I loved him and my niece. She's a good girl and doesn't deserve what happened to her. Get her home as soon as possible. You can go. \
&#x20;   Luxurious «Rolls-Royce» has been waiting for forty minutes at the night jazz club «Honey Palace», but its passengers were in no hurry to get out of the car. Apparently, the nightly temptations that this fashionable establishment offered were not their priority at the moment. Fatso and Long were waiting. They were both dressed in very nice black suits, and there was a small bag of money in the back seat. The bandits decided that for the upcoming meeting they needed some gloss, and did their best. The icing on the cake was a luxurious car, which they begged from the accountant of the Einstein gang, assuring him that without a cool car, their operation is simply doomed to failure. Reluctantly, his arthritic joints creaking, Einstein donated his personal car to the cause, having previously told in detail what he would do with them if even one scratch appeared on the «Rolls-Royce».

&#x20;   The gangsters philosophized out of boredom and watched the glittering crowd flock to the beautiful four-story building that had once served the city as the «Museum of the History of Kegs and Cans». Here you could get everything that is allowed and prohibited, especially without worrying about raids and searches, since the initiators of these events themselves visited here at least once a week. If raids did occur, then all interested parties were warned about this at least a month in advance. Here they bet on running hedgehogs and fighting bees, played roulette and the black market, drank wild honey cocktails and ate real honeycombs, listened to jazz and fashionable poets who had fallen into hard drinking and decadence. There was no prohibition here, but there were clear rules that even gang leaders, movie stars and relatives of the Mayor were obliged to follow. Casino, nightclub, brothel, bookmaker, meeting place, restaurant, honey and opium den – «Honey Palace» was truly a new Babylon for a small, but by no means the best part of the population of Bear City. \
&#x20;   Fatso lit a cigarette, exhaling a puff of thick smoke.

\- Not a bad Cave, - he said, - I used to be here quite often. But then I got bored. Everyone pretends to have fun with might and main, and in the eyes - emptiness.

\- Crisis, - sighed Long, - Great Depression. This is not only a shortage of honey, an empty gold bee supply, cone inflation and a jump in the price of bread and nuts. Bears are changing. This is the main consequence of any crisis... At that moment, his chubby colleague noticed something interesting in the rearview mirror. He quickly threw away the cigarette and turned to his partner:

\- She arrived!

### `Chapter IV`
****

&#x20;   Artemis Ginger parked her Fiat behind cool car, slammed the door, and headed for the Honey Palace entrance. Her expensive open evening gown contrasted sharply with her more than modest means of transportation. Miss Ginger was moving so fast that the bandits did not even have time to get out of the car.

\- Miss Ginger! Fatso called out to her a little louder than he planned, because he seriously feared that he would not have time to intercept her before entering the nightclub, - Can I have you for one minute? \
Artemis stopped. Then she walked over to the «Rolls-Royce» and leaned against the window, propping her knee on the passenger door. Now Fatso would not be able to get out of the car without interference if it occurred to him.

\- Well, well, - the reporter drawled, - guys from the Grizzly gang. What do you need boys?

\- Just to talk, - Fatso replied politely, appreciating her trick with the door, - could you get in our car?

\- Where are the two gangsters already sitting? Are you taking me for an idiot? Long leaned from the driver's seat to the passenger door.

\- Miss Ginger, - he said calmly, - we are acting on behalf of our boss, and you yourself know that he appreciates you and your work very highly. I assure you, nothing threatens you, except for the loss of five minutes. Please. Miss Ginger looked around quickly, sighed, opened the door and got into the back seat.

\- I timed it. Five minutes. The bandits looked at each other. Deciding that Long took the right tone; Fatso ceded the right to negotiate to a more sophisticated «comrade».

\- Miss Ginger, - Long turned to Artemis, - we believe you have information on the whereabouts of Ellie Eleanor Grizzly Preserved. We would be very happy to receive this information in order to return the unfortunate girl home to her uncle. For information, we are ready to offer a solid reward. Long fell silent, Fatso chuckled approvingly.

\- Wow! – Artemis was amazed, - That's the speech! But what makes you guys think that I have information? Did they overhear me when I tried to get Old Polar Bear to do his duty?

\- That's right, - Long was not at all embarrassed, - but, as far as we understand, you didn't tell him everything. By the way, my name is Long, and my friend and partner is Fatso.

\- And how much is the Grizzly Godfather willing to pay for information? - Artemis chuckled. - I heard he's not very generous.

\- One hundred thousand.&#x20;

Artemis whistled.

\- Not bad for a start. But what makes you think that my information costs so much? There is little I can add to what you have already heard.

\- Three hundred thousand.

&#x20;Artemis raised her hand.

\- Hold the moose, fire tower! Well, I'll tell you, and what's next? You are thugs; missions to save girls are not your style.

\- Five hundred thousand.

Miss Ginger fell silent - the colossal amount really shocked her. The gangsters also did not say another word, realizing that now is the time to give the girl a little to recover and think.

&#x20;   Artemis did not remain silent for long; it was not in her rules. True, when she spoke, little was left of her playfully mocking tone.

\- Well, that's big money. I see the Godfather Grizzly really wants to bring the little one home. But I wouldn’t drive a lousy car and live on the outskirts in a small apartment with my mother if I took money for information and wrote custom articles.

\- We know that, - said Fatso cautiously, - but this is not about professional ethics. The fate and even the life of a young bear are at stake. And we have very little time to save her, if she is really in the clutches of the Pandas.

&#x20;Miss Ginger leaned forward and stared at the gangsters for a few seconds. In this short period of time, Fatso and Long felt naked, helpless, enchanted, interrogated, called to account, sentenced to death, x-rayed and repentant in confession.

\- Okay, - Artemis coped with emotions, made a conclusion and made a decision, - I accept your offer - but on my own terms. I don't need money. And Ellie's fate worries me as much as you do. But I also have my own selfish motive - I have long dreamed of conducting my own journalistic investigation. And now I have a chance - especially since our valiant police do not want to listen to anything. I'm not a fool, so I perfectly understand that I can't do it alone, so I made an appointment at the «Honey Palace» with the best private detective in the city. He is waiting for me at a table by the window. But, since such a thing, I change his worthy candidacy for your dubious faces. I suppose this is logical, given your interest, as well as the degree of danger of the enterprise. In general, we are going to save the girl together!

&#x20;   During her speech, Fatso and Long's faces gradually stretched out in surprise. When Miss Ginger had finished, the gangsters spoke quickly, loudly and constantly interrupting each other.

\- It's impossible!

\- Under no circumstances!

\- It's out of the question!

\- Do you realize how dangerous it is?!

\- This is pure madness!

Artemis waited patiently for them to breathe, shrugged her shoulders, and opened the car door.

\- Well, I won't take up your time. Good luck. And Mr. Hunter is waiting for me, he is a real professional, a gentleman and...

\- Hunter? Billy «Winnie the Pooh» Hunter?! This cretin?! - Long interrupted her and laughed.

\- It's strange how such a smart girl like you could contact this idiot, - said Fatso, - do you know that one day this so-called private detective was cleaning a gun at home and shot his pet pig?

\- It was an accident! - said Miss Ginger.

\- Have Hunter all accidents! - Long said categorically, - Poor Piglet! With the last of his strength, he tried to crawl up to Winnie to bite, but he did not have time! Fatso shook his head reproachfully.

\- That bear cannot be trusted with your life, Miss Ginger. You are making a huge mistake. Artemis closed the door.

\- You think I'll be safer with you than with Billy Hunter? The gangsters laughed.

\- This comparison is simply insulting. With us you are in a safe!

\- Fact! - Fatso confirmed.

\- Well, - sighed Miss Ginger meekly, - then let's go. Since we agreed on everything and you yourself said that I am completely safe in your company, why waste time? Long and Fatso looked at each other. They felt like complete idiots and, in fact, at the moment they were. Long sighed heavily, started the engine and switched on the headlights.

\- Don't you want to warn Hunter?

\- Nope, - Artemis said nonchalantly, - he’ll find something to do. As far as I know, he is a regular customer of «Honey Palace».

### `Chapter V`
****

&#x20;   The «Rolls-Royce», snatching space from the dark streets with the bright light of its headlights, was speeding rapidly towards the Southeast. Two bears and a female bear inside the car physically felt the tension growing as they approached the goal. Of course, there were no reasons for relaxation. Especially after Artemis told her partners that all her sources independently indicated one place of detention for Ellie Grizzly - Dirty Louie's establishment. Louis-Theodore Fossett, a large koala with matted fur of indeterminate color, fully corresponded to his nickname - both from a physical and moral point of view. Louis's place had a bad reputation, but still not as bad as its owner. Dirty Louis was tied up on the fact that he carried out small, but dirty errands for the southern and southeastern groups of Pandas. He was not shy about cooperating even with such scumbags as Marmalade. Ellie was in the clutches of a notorious scumbag, but that wasn't the worst thing.

&#x20;    Long and Fatso told Artemis that Pandas had a practice of pumping their victims with huge doses of molasses so that the client would behave calmly. Miss Ginger and both Bears were well aware that after 48 hours of active consumption, this stuff caused irreversible changes in the bears' brains, turning them into dependent living scarecrows, unable to fully think and exist. Yes, our company had a reason to hurry up!&#x20;

&#x20;   When Dirty Louie's place was only a couple of kilometers away, the Fatso began to instruct Artemis. In his opinion, Miss Ginger's entire role in their mission was to lie on the floor of the car and shake with fear.

\- This is not for you to write articles, - he finished weightily, - so that you understand. Artemis snorted.

\- So that you understand! - She mimicked, - What an expression! What kind of forests brought you to the big city, buddy?

\- From Canada! Long smiled, remembering the morning meeting with the Fisherbear.

\- Where is it? - asked Miss Ginger.

\- I don't know, - Long admitted, - but a friend claims that very smart beavers live there. Catching the Fatso angry look, he added seriously,

\- Boss will skin us alive if anything happens to you, Miss Ginger.

\- Oh, don't worry about that! - The reporter waved her hand. - He won't even have time to get to you. Mom will take care of you first. My mom! What an old lady! Why do you think I'm not married yet?\
&#x20;   Louie's was exactly what a mid-range hangout with strippers and a lousy bar should look like. The bar offered not only the relatively safe, though forbidden, mead and heather, but also more serious things, and the striptease was just a warm-up to a more savory pastime at an affordable price. \
&#x20;   Long knew this establishment like his own five claws, as at one time he often met here to resolve business issues with representatives of various gangs. Since Artemis flatly refused to stay in the car, the trio entered through the VIP entrance, and a friendly security guard, who perfectly remembered the grizzly bear named «Long», escorted them to one of the best table’s right next to the stage. Twilight reigned in the hall, a half-drunk musician strummed on the piano in the corner; criminals of all stripes were sitting at the tables mixed with ruined brokers. Two naked she-bears danced on the stage, and the waitress, who brought them mead in a long bottle, was not distinguished by an abundance of clothes. The companions did not linger in the hall - having taken a drink, they dived into a dark corridor leading to the lair of the owner of the establishment.&#x20;

&#x20;   At an inconspicuous door at the end of the corridor, a huge panda, Lee Larry, Dirty Louie's personal bodyguard, was on duty.

\- Hi, Lee, - Long greeted, - how is you?

\- Excellent, Mr. Bear, - the big man smiled, - is you to the owner? I'll just warn him.

\- Don't! - Long stopped him, - I have a surprise for him. With a slight nod of his head, he pointed at Miss Ginger, and Fatso, for added effect, loudly slapped the top reporter of Bear News Time on the ass. Artemis bit her lip in anger, but restrained herself, determined to postpone the massacre until better times.

\- Ah, got it! - Lee Larry smiled broadly and nodded, the boss's voluptuousness was well known to him. - Well, go ahead!

Three bears and one koala, which had been in the same closed and rather stinking space of a small office for forty-five minutes, were deadly bored. Dirty Louis was not a fool; otherwise he would not have lived so long, constantly balancing on the edge of a knife. He immediately understood why they had come, and besides, he knew perfectly well who Miss Ginger was, so the game of bears and mice was ruled out immediately. But this circumstance did not save time - Louis denied with truly donkey tenacity. He, they say, only heard something about the kidnapping of Ellie and the death of Uncle Grizzly, but he really doesn’t know anything, but this girl was definitely not here, he can swear on this even with his own bag! And even if there was, he still would not have told them anything - this is the territory of the pandas; they are in charge here, and not Godfather Grizzly, with all due respect to him. And they shouldn't have dragged a reporter here - she's hobnobbing with the police and the Mayor, and this is a violation of the code. In general, he cannot help them in any way, and even if he could, he still would not. Louis was not afraid of intruders, although he was not even armed. He did not need a gun - the owner of the establishment was in his own right and on his territory, and no one had been able to press him properly for several years now. Conversation in this spirit has already gone to the twelfth round. Fatso, who stood guard at the front door, really wanted a drink, but even that was impossible - Dirty Louie added molasses to his mead. Long, lounging in a relatively clean guest chair, bored eyes Louis, squirming in his chair and every second shifting the papers on the old desk. Miss Ginger walked around the study, occasionally catching annoyed glances from the owner. Figuring out that a koala was especially nervous when she walked up to a bookshelf; Artemis began to carefully examine the spines of the books. It was mostly cheap junk - trash novels with erotic details or explicit pornography, men's magazines like Playbear, pamphlets with recipes for mead and tinctures, and car almanacs - but one book caught Miss Ginger's attention. She stood out against this motley background, like a bee in milk.

\- Catcher in honey, - Artemis whispered, - but how… At this point, Dirty Louie lost his patience.

\- Hey girl! - The koala climbed onto the table and put her hands on her hips, - Could you stop rummaging through my shelves? It's personal! But it was too late. Miss Ginger tugged on the spine, and the bookshelf immediately slid aside along with the armored panel hidden behind it. The pneumatic mechanism worked perfectly - the secret passage opened almost without a single sound. Dirty Louis groaned and covered his eyes with his paws, and Long whistled admiringly and immediately went to the secret room, not forgetting to grab a revolver from his holster. Yes, just in case.

Dirty Louis groaned and covered his eyes with his paws, and Long whistled admiringly and immediately went to the secret room, not forgetting to grab a revolver from his holster. Yes, just in case.

\- Blimey! - Fatso breathed out. - Miss Ginger, I am delighted. How did you guess?!

\- Thank you, - Artemis said coldly. She hadn't forgotten his spanking yet. By the way, she was not going to forget anything at all. - The Catcher in Honey is too serious a read for a strip club owner and small-time drug dealer.

\- Don’t forget to remind me, I’ll give you a medal for observation sometime, - Louis grinned, but real fear froze in his eyes. Ignoring him, Fatso, Long, and Artemis peered into a small rectangular room, brightly lit and completely white. There were no windows, but judging by the sounds, ventilation and a power plant were constantly working here.

\- Hey, you can't go there! - squealed the koala. Louis jumped off the table and ran into the white room, paws spread wide. - Stop! Stay where you are! But the companions have already seen everything they need. The laboratory for the production of molasses and artificial honey was small, designed for only three jobs, but equipped with the most modern equipment. An experienced look of the Fatso’s instantly determined that the productivity was about a kilogram of the finished product per day. Apparently, the laboratory worked only during the day, when there was almost no one in the club except the staff. Now it was quiet here, the workers were serving customers or relaxing, and all the equipment was carefully washed and covered. Barrels and cans of raw materials stood in the corners.

\- Eh, Louis, - Fatso shook his head reproachfully, - again you took up the old business. But the pandas have already warned you not to get into their business. As far as I remember, you were treating burned ears for three months. But your greed is stronger than your fear even of Gummy Bears, right, dirty? And aren't you ashamed to steal fir cones from your patrons?

\- None of your business! - The koala hissed.

\- Shut up, Cheburashka, - Long said it with zero intonation, which was usually a harbinger of multiple fractures in his interlocutors, - shut up, think for a second, and then start talking. You know what we want to hear. And you know what I'll tell your bosses if we don't hear it. Louis shut up. Then he gestured for them to move away from the wall, after which he pressed the spine of the book again - the panel with the shelf returned to its place. The owner of the establishment climbed onto his chair and put his paws on the table.

\- Well, - he said softly, - she's been here for a few days. She was picked up today, just a couple of hours before your visit.

\- Who took it? - asked Fatso.

\- Brown bears. The pandas sold the girl to them when it became known that Uncle had given up. In this situation, it is no longer necessary for them.

\- What did they do? - Artemis asked.

\- Sold. Is your hearing bad?

\- Where did you keep her? - Long joined the conversation.

\- She worked in the hall as a waitress, but there was no sense from her, only problems. So basically she was crying and sleeping upstairs.

\- In your makeshift brothel? - Fatso said.

\- She had her own room, no one touched her.

\- Did you give her molasses? - Miss Ginger looked at Louis with such contempt that Fatso wondered how he hadn't fallen through the ground yet. Dirty was silent. Long leaned over the table and, trying not to touch the dirty tabletop, quietly and distinctly repeated the reporter's question:

\- Did you give her molasses?

\- Only a couple of times, - Louis looked away, - when she started screaming and scaring customers with her daddy and uncle. Nothing bad happened to her, I know what I'm doing! Long and Fatso looked at each other. Miss Ginger was silent, her lips compressed tightly. Fatso carefully took the girl's hand.

\- Where did they take her? - The tall gangster was still hovering over the table, his eyes fixed on the koala.

\- To the farm.

\- Where is it? Fifty kilometers east of the city. They have illegal beehives and raspberry plantations there. It's called «Berloga». That's all what I know.

\- Okay, Louis. I guess it's not in your best interest to lie. I'm in a hurry right now, but I'll definitely be back. There's something else I need to discuss with you... He was already heading for the door when Louis laughed softly.

\- Yeah, - the koala grinned, - of course you will return, if the Brown bears don’t spoil your skins, which I sincerely hope for. And if you still decide to drop in, take this reporter with you. And you can also have a relative of your boss at the same time. With pleasure… Mr. Louis-Theodore Fossett could not finish his thought. Artemis darted towards him like lightning, grabbed the koala by the ears, and slammed her snout against the table with all her might.

\- I don't know about Long, - whispered Miss Ginger, looking into Dirty Louie's dilated pupils of pain, fear and rage as he wiped snot and blood on the sleeves of his dirty jacket. - But I will definitely take advantage of your invitation. So it's better for you, marsupial monkey, to collect your belongings and get out of the city - and as soon as possible!

### `Chapter VI`
****

The night was moonlit. I wonder how many novels began with this boring line for everyone, how many chapters were spoiled by this terrible stamp? But what the hell do you order the author to do if the light rain stopped, the clouds dispersed, a warm breeze blew, and the night suddenly became warm and… moonlit like in summer?!

The companions sat in a car parked on the side of the highway and listened attentively to Long, who had returned from a reconnaissance raid half an hour ago. The information received by an experienced gangster was disappointing, and therefore the plan developed by our trio was extremely simple and extremely risky.

Two hundred meters from the car rose the dark outline of a farm - a huge barn, sheds, water tanks, rows of beehives hidden behind a forest belt, raspberry and heather plantations artfully camouflaged with rows of corn. But the gangsters and the reporter were most interested in a small house - a «izbushka» built from simple logs. The izbushka was small, one-room, with a low door and a single window. It was difficult to suspect Long of an excessive love for wooden architecture - he gave such a detailed description of the house only because it was there that the browns from the Circus gang kept Ellie-Eleanor Grizzly. Long also found out something else - in the morning the young she-bear was supposed to be taken away in an unknown direction, which means that they simply did not have time to call for reinforcements.

Fatso muttered:

\- If I remember everything correctly, our brilliant plan is as follows - we drive Einstein's wheelbarrow into the barn and arrange a shootout with the Circus Bears there. Browns from all over the farm come running to the noise, including the guards of the hut. Artemis sneaks into the house through the window, frees Ellie, returns the same way, and waits for us in the bushes by the highway. At this time, we deal with the whole gang, take away their chickens and rabbits from the sobbing «Michaels», and triumphantly deliver Miss Ginger and the boss's niece home. Great plan. But there is one thing you missed. Before the operation, we just need to put on superhero tights and raincoats!

\- We don’t have tights and raincoats, - Long objected, - and I strongly object to you dragging any suspicious rural living creatures into the «Rolls-Royce»!

\- Do you know why we don't have superhero tights? Because we are not superheroes, damn you! And at the moment we are going to risk not only our own fur, but also the lives of Miss Ginger and Ellie!

Artemis placed her soft paw on his shoulder.

\- Listen, Fatso, this is the worst plan possible, but we still have no other options. I went. Good luck guys.

The reporter got out of the car and glided like a silent shadow to a large rainwater reservoir, which was located just behind the hut.

Long followed the girl with his eyes, took a deep breath, and started the engine.

\- So, I ask you to consider the meeting of the suicide club open! Fatso grumbled quietly, involuntarily giving the name of the operation, about which legends and songs would be composed a little later.

Artemis waited with bated breath. She saw the luxury car, without its headlights on, moving slowly and almost silently towards the barn. Fortunately, the farm was quiet; the guards had not yet noticed the car with the gangsters from the Grizzly gang. Maybe it's for the best that civilization has taken away from bears their perfect sense of smell and sharp hearing.

The «Rolls-Royce», like a pirate frigate, was approaching the barn where most of the farm's guards had gathered. From the open windows of the huge building poured light and the sounds of an accordion. Long said that the outside guards were posted only at the hut. Well, no bad.

Right in front of the gates, a powerful engine roared, and headlights flashed brightly in the darkness - and several tons of reliable and very expensive iron crashed into the heavy gates with a roar. Started! Artemis crouched down on the ground.

Bears, like people, are prone to somewhat stereotypical thinking - for example, they get very scared when a car drives into their house. The Browns bears from the Circus gang have seen a lot in their lifetime, but they have never had to deal with such a spectacular attack. As another justification for their confusion, we can say that some of the guards and farm workers were sleeping, and suddenly awakened bears are in principle incapable of a deep analysis of the situation. Long's and Fatso's maneuver was a 100% success - the browns rushed around the barn, fell down the stairs, stumbled, climbed on the poles, shot anywhere and generally behaved unworthily.

Gangsters from the Grizzly gang had fun in full - Long deftly maneuvered in the limited space of the barn, and Fatso fired from his Colt non-stop, not giving the enemy the slightest chance to recover and organize worthy resistance. In vain the leader of the farm security service, the huge brown bear Boris brandished his Mauser and roared loudly, deafening his subordinates - Circus Bears now fully lived up to their nickname. Long and Fatso were not bloodthirsty monsters, therefore, no one was directly injured from their actions in the first minutes - the brown ones successfully inflicted all injuries and wounds on their own, while they were trying to figure out where their own people were, where strangers.

Artemis was not waiting in vain! A dozen brown bandits guarding the hut simply couldn’t find a place for themselves from the very moment the barn turned into a rural branch of hell. They were torn between the order to guard the prisoner and the burning desire to immediately rush to the aid of screaming comrades, or at least find out what was the matter. Finally, three could not stand it and left the place of service - and a second later the rest joined them. In the end, everything was quiet and calm on the street; no one attacked the house with the captive! The last, stealthily looking around, and the post left the young bear Yuri, who was on duty in the "izbushka" itself. He did not dare to move far from the hut, but loomed on the street, trying in vain to determine how many enemy gangs were shelling their farm at the same time.

Miss Ginger trotted over the few meters separating the tank from the house. She pressed herself against the wall, pulled the shutters of the only window towards her. A simple iron hook that locks the doors from the inside? Ha! In less than three seconds, Artemis was already untying Ellie Grizzly, who was laid in the corner on an ordinary wooden bed with a thin mattress. The rest of the furnishings were in the same Spartan style - a small stove, firewood in the corner, a table and two chairs. The house smelled of hay, milk and honey. A wonderful place, but only if you are here of your own free will!

Artemis helped herself with her claws and fangs, but the knots were clearly a master of her craft. Finally, Miss Ginger guessed to pull the gag out of Ellie's mouth, and a young round she-bear, who had recently taken a decisive step from a teenager to women, began to help the reporter, digging into the knots with her sharp teeth. The screams, shots, and roars from outside grew louder. A loud clatter was heard very close by - brown bears guarding the apiary were pulling up to the scene. One of them, running past the hut, barked at Yuri:

\- Hey you, marmalade clown! Come on; get back to your post! The young guard hurried to fulfill the order of his senior comrades. When he touched the doorknob, Ellie was ripping off the last ropes...

Yuri entered the hut and locked the door behind him. Turning around, he was stunned - instead of the captive, who did nothing but squeal, scream and bite until she was tied up, he saw a chic young she-bear in an evening dress, as appropriate on the farm as his boss Boris on a tricycle. Artemis smiled charmingly at Yuri as she elegantly leaned her graceful thigh against the rustic stove. The young bear's jaw literally fell off from this spectacle - and then he himself collapsed to the floor. Ellie, hiding at the door with a heavy log in her paws, hit him on the head so much that Yuri regained consciousness only two days later. The enraged Miss Grizzly, throwing away the log, also intended to grab the offender by the ear, but Artemis did not allow the young bear to abuse the defeated enemy - grabbing the niece of the mafia boss by the collar, she pushed her out the window, and after a moment she left the hut herself. Two she-bears disappeared into the moonlit night. Ellie was almost saved; it remained to wait at the appointed place for the rest of the «superhero» team.

Long and Fatso, on the other hand, weren't doing so well. Having received reinforcements and realizing that there were far fewer than a thousand enemies who attacked their farm, the brown bears themselves rushed to the attack, pouring lead rain from machine guns and pistols over the Rolls-Royce. Some desperate daredevils even threw themselves on the hood and roof of the car, but Long was on the alert, and effortlessly threw the brave men onto the wooden floor. In principle, the moment to say goodbye to the barn had long come, but the grizzly gangsters wanted to give Artemis as much time as possible.

A burst of machine-gun fire burst through the doors and Fatso groaned, clutching his shot shoulder with his paw.

\- Damn it! Hold on buddy, we're finishing the show!

The car suddenly skidded, turned around and was thrown right into one of the pillars supporting the roof of the barn. The engine had stalled, the stunned grizzlies were just recovering, and a flock of brown bears, with jubilant cries, had already swarmed around the car like a swarm of mad bees.

\- Fatso, shoots! - Long barked, with all four paws fighting off the brown bandits, who opened the car doors and pulled their clawed paws and opens maws with powerful fangs towards their companions. If the Circus Bears had decided to use their weapons, the story would have ended at this sad moment. But the browns were ruined by their cruelty and the desire to tear the guys from the Grizzly gang apart with their own paws.

Fatso shot a couple of particularly aggressive individuals at point-blank range, but this only angered the others even more. At this moment, hardly any of the outside observers could believe that this bloodthirsty crowd is civilized creatures with a developed entertainment industry and high self-esteem.

Long, receiving deafening blows with his paws and wounds from sharp claws, stubbornly did not allow himself to be pulled out of the car. Desperately fighting back and cutting opponents with the last words, the fearless grizzly tried to start the car, knowing full well that this was their only chance. Miracles sometimes happen if you believe in them, especially if circumstances force you to believe. The engine suddenly growled, and the brown bears roared with rage. Long instantly oriented himself, steadfastly withstood a new hail of blows, cut into reverse gear and squeezed the gas pedal to the floor. The Rolls-Royce, having knocked out the emergency gates that had survived in the mess, flew backwards from the hillock, dropping brown bears trying to cling to the car along the way. Those Circus bandits who managed to get into the salon quickly flew out of it right on the move - despite the injury, Fatso, inspired by the possible rescue, put not only strength, but also soul into each blow.

Turning the car, Long engaged first gear and brought the Rolls-Royce onto the highway.

\- How are the passengers?

\- Out! - Fatso replied quietly.

Long smiled. He was not afraid of the chase - the tires of both trucks of the bandit farmers were punctured during the reconnaissance raid. From the direction of the hillock, shooting was still heard, but it was no longer serious. Despite the injuries, blows and bites, both gangsters thought of only one thing - did Artemis and Ellie manage to get out of the hut?

It wasn't until they saw the mangled, bullet-riddled, glassless, dung-stained Rolls-Royce that hid in the bushes off the highway that Artemis and Ellie had a full idea of ​​the ordeal Long and Fatso had to go through. And when the girls climbed into the car, the iron Miss Ginger could no longer hold back her tears at the sight of her crippled comrades. Artemis sat in the back seat with Fatso and was now trying to dress his wound. The gangster smiled.

\- Nothing, nothing, Miss Ginger. Just work. The main thing is that you succeeded. I swear by the eternal Big Dipper - you are the most courageous girl!

Long did not waste energy on compliments - he drove quickly and with concentration, trying not to pay attention to Ellie's loving glances. When the companions saw the lights of Bear City, Fatso became worse - he constantly tried to pass out, despite the best efforts of Artemis.

\- Be patient, buddy, - Long said softly. - We'll be at the hospital in fifteen minutes.

\- I’d rather have something to drink, - said the Fat Man without opening his eyes, - I hope Einstein will let me drain a bottle of beer before he kills me for his wheelbarrow.

## `Epilogue`

The Mayor's office was as chic as its owner, a handsome black grizzly bear. A huge oak table, portraits of kings and presidents on the walls, numerous photographs of the Mayor himself and his relatives, flags, coats of arms, newspaper articles in glazed frames, heavy crystal ashtrays, golden pens and inkwells. The office was flooded with the autumn sun, penetrating here through two huge windows. The end of the most cloudy and depressing time of the year turned out to be extremely warm and sunny.

The Mayor sat at his luxurious desk and carefully read the front page of Bear News Time, namely the article with the intriguing title «The Suicide Club Meeting, or Why Real Superheroes Don't Wear Tights». The article detailed and vividly described the adventures of a month ago, in which Artemis Ginger, a reporter for the city's best-selling newspaper, took the most active part. All names in the publication have been changed, as well as some details that could somehow indicate the real participants in the rescue mission. All names except Miss Ginger, of course. The article was decorated with only one picture - it was a photograph of the Mayor.

Artemis was currently sitting across from him in the visitor's chair, studying the Mayor's reaction and musing that he was basically just as corrupt as his predecessors, with one exception - the Mayor was a little silly, conceited and overly romantic, which prevented him from becoming a real bastard. Also, sometimes he actually did something useful for Bear City, which was already a major achievement.

Miss Ginger has changed. She lost weight and became even more beautiful. At least that's what her fans said. Artemis now wore black suits and elegant cloaks, which made her, look more mysterious and strict. The mayor finished reading the article, put down the newspaper, and gazed at the author with an idiotically loving look.

\- Delightful, Miss Ginger. Amazing, wonderful, amazing! - He roared, - How many awards and prizes have you received for it? Seven?

\- Eight if you count the Paddington Literary Prize, - Artemis smiled.

\- I would give you all the awards! - Said the Mayor, - This article is a real masterpiece of journalistic art! And I am very pleased that you found the opportunity to mention your obedient servant in this publication…in the most flattering way.

\- Thank you, - said Miss Ginger gravely, - but there is not a word of flattery or exaggeration. Your taking on Louis Fossett and his filthy den is great news for our city. And I perfectly understand the resistance you had to face...

\- Yes, - the Mayor chuckled, - the opposition press has been mixing me with shit for a week, claiming that I organized the persecution of honest business, so I am extremely grateful to you for your support, Miss Ginger.

The Mayor took a box of expensive cigarettes from a drawer, offered Artemis, and lit a cigarette himself.

\- May I ask you, - he began cautiously, - about the fate of the participants in this brilliant rescue mission?

The reporter smiled.

\- Okay. After this incident, the rescued girl finally realized what she wanted from life. She went to university and is about to marry one of her saviors.

\- For a tall and thin guy! - Guessed the Mayor, - How is he doing?

\- He's fine, but he still walks with a cane and gives shots for rabies. His employer praised his role in the operation...in terms of money. Plus, he got a promotion. True, I don’t know how relevant this is now - there are rumors that after the wedding he will leave this business and do something more…safe. The bride, who has now become a real favorite of the head of the family, insists on this.

\- I understand. What about «Plump»? Has he recovered?

Artemis nodded, but didn't smile anymore - the unpleasant memories still made her feel extremely negative.

\- Yes, yes, although he got the most. When we took him to the hospital, it was really bad - he lost a lot of blood. It's a miracle that he was saved. Now he is already at home, under the care of a loving wife and excellent doctors. Of course, he also received his share of praises and an award. His boss is about to start a new business, exporting maple syrup...oops, maple leaves from Canada. Immediately after a full recovery, Plump will take the place of the curator. In general, he also got a safer and well-paid job. Well, my story is already well known to you, Mr. Mayor. The owner of the office considered.

\- And the car? What happened to the car?

Miss Ginger laughed out loud.

Why is everyone asking about this?! It was decided that it was too expensive to restore it, so the car was patched up a bit and sold to another continent. The owner was given a new one - free of charge, at the expense of the company. True, with the condition that he will never let other members of the organization drive.

The Mayor smiled.

\- I'm glad that everything ended quite well…for everyone. By the way, I have an idea here, Miss Ginger, and I would really like to discuss it with you specifically.

Artemis tensed a little. The last time her interlocutor had an «idea», it was about the first ever flight of a bear into space.

\- Yesterday the head of the city police sat in your place. He talked for two hours about the difficulties that his office is facing, and at the end of the monologue he asked for more funding. And without any guarantees. Give me money and we'll see. As you can imagine, this situation does not suit me at all...

\- Maybe in this case it is worth changing the chief of police? Miss Ginger suggested cautiously.

\- It does not depend on me, - the Mayor lit another cigarette, - the heads of law enforcement agencies are appointed from above. But even if I began to actively dig under the Old Polar and achieved his resignation, nothing would change. No one will send us a young, active, talented and incorruptible police chief. It will be the same «Old Polar» - a clumsy, stupid and corrupt bear, thinking only about his pension. But that's not all...you think I did the right thing by closing Louis' striptease club, right? But you and I are well aware that very soon a dozen new establishments will appear in our city - exactly the same, if not worse.

A few words about your wonderful operation. I have learned that those against whom it was directed are hatching plans for revenge. You thwarted a major deal, defeated one of their bases and seriously damaged their reputation - now their business in the slave trade of young she-bears is under threat. Do you know what the chief of our valiant police said to me? Nothing! He doesn't know what's going on in his city at all.

Artemis frowned. «He is not such a fool as he wants to appear», thought Miss Ginger, but said aloud:

\- I heard about it. I think that those who are directly affected by this information also know about it. Sure, Bear City isn't safe, but...

\- Our city isn't just unsafe, Miss Ginger. He is dangerous. But your article gave me a way out of this situation...

The Mayor quickly and very carefully looked at the reporter.

\- Yes, Mr. Mayor.

\- Superheroes, Artemis. The bears you wrote about. They are the ones who can fix the situation. Miss Ginger fell into a slight stupor, during which she mentally crossed out her own thought:

«He's not such a fool».

\- Sorry?!

\- Superheroes! - Stubbornly repeat the Mayor, - More precisely, a team of superheroes. Just imagine - let's say you are a coordinator and an ideological inspirer, we will not allow you to climb into the thick of it anymore. Your friends design the operations and are responsible for their perfect implementation. The team of performers will be selected thoughtfully and carefully. Miss Ginger, together we...

Artemis raised her paw and rather impolitely interrupted the owner of the office:

\- Mister Mayor, stop! Superheroes are fiction, myth, fairy tale...

\- This «fairy tale» you and your companions made a reality.

\- These are comic book characters, they do not exist in reality, and they wear capes and tights!

\- Artemis, your friends are real bears. Let them work incognito; I'm not against privacy at all. Don't like tights? Well, let them wear masks or hoods.



\- Mr. Mayor, superheroes have supernatural powers!

\- So are your friends, so are you, Miss Ginger. Courage, a lively mind, the ability to find a way out of the most difficult situations, self-sacrifice, honor - aren't these supernatural abilities in our time?! Think, Artemis, think! Who, if not you, will make this city better, cleaner, safer? And what prospects! Let your brilliant article be the first in the diamond chronicle of a team of real superheroes! You will become a celebrity far beyond the borders of our city, and then write a whole book...

Miss Ginger chuckled - this bastard knows which levers to press!

\- Mr. Mayor, I don’t know how clear it was from the publication, but my friends…they… The Mayor quickly raised his paw.

\- You don't have to say those words in my office! The walls have ears, and I don't want my ill-wishers to accuse me of having ties...with anti-social elements. I understood perfectly. But what does it change? Nothing! Better to let them defend the city as superheroes than smash as part of their…organizations. Besides, one does not interfere with the other. I have never been against part-time work.

Artemis did not give up:

\- What about funding?

\- Allocate money from the funds. We will attract sponsors. With the right advertising, there will be many who want to. Miss Ginger looked at the Mayor with surprise. Had this cretin managed to interest her? We need to discuss this with Long and Fatso.

\- Mister Mayor, this is really an interesting proposal. But I need to think.

\- Of course, - the black grizzly smiled his magnificent professional smile, - I will patiently await your wise and considered decision, Artemis.

When the door closed behind the reporter, the Mayor smiled quite sincerely. Let small, but a victory! Taking out a notepad and colored pencils hidden there from the bottom drawer of the desk, the head of a huge city enthusiastically indulged in his favorite hobby - drawing. On the first sheet, he depicted the head of a dead bear with a protruding tongue and crosses instead of eyes. Above the terrible head, the artist painstakingly drew the inscription: «Meeting of the Suicide Club». Very pleased with himself, the Mayor turned the page and began to sketch the main team members and secondary characters...

# `The End`
